# Simple Question and Answer Project

A cool project for searching text and generating answers with AI. I used Flask for web and API, with a lightweight model (distillgpt2) for answering and sentence-transformers for finding related text.

## What's in it?
- A retriever that finds related text from .txt files.
- A generator that generates answers with distilgpt2.
- A simple web page for asking questions.
- An API for testing with cURL or Postman.
- Logs are saved to a file.

## How do I get started?
1. Clone the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Parham-Dehghan/simple-rag-llmops.git
cd simple-rag-llmops
